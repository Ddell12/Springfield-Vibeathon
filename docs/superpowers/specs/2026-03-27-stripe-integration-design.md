# Stripe Integration — Design Spec

> **Date:** 2026-03-27
> **Status:** Approved
> **Scope:** Free + Premium ($9.99/mo) subscription billing via `@convex-dev/stripe` component

---

## 1. Objective

Add subscription billing to Bridges so that free users are gated on usage limits and can upgrade to Premium for unlimited access. Use the `@convex-dev/stripe` Convex component to handle Checkout Sessions, webhook sync, and Customer Portal — minimizing custom code.

### Success Criteria

- Free users can build and save up to 5 apps and 3 flashcard decks
- Upgrade flow takes the user to Stripe-hosted checkout and back in under 60 seconds
- Subscription state syncs reactively — UI updates without page refresh after payment
- Premium users have no usage limits
- Users can cancel via Stripe Customer Portal (self-service)

---

## 2. Tier Structure

| | Free | Premium ($9.99/mo) |
|---|---|---|
| Saved apps | 5 | Unlimited |
| Flashcard decks | 3 | Unlimited |
| Templates | Basic set | Full library |
| TTS | Communication boards only | Priority TTS everywhere |
| Image generation | Standard | Custom image upload |

Unauthenticated users continue to use the builder freely. Limits only apply once a user signs in and starts saving/persisting work.

---

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Component Wiring

The `@convex-dev/stripe` component (v0.1.3) registers in `convex/convex.config.ts` alongside existing components:

```typescript
// convex/convex.config.ts
import rag from "@convex-dev/rag/convex.config";
import rateLimiter from "@convex-dev/rate-limiter/convex.config.js";
import stripe from "@convex-dev/stripe/convex.config";
import { defineApp } from "convex/server";

const app = defineApp();
app.use(rag);
app.use(rateLimiter);
app.use(stripe);

export default app;
```

The component manages its own isolated tables (`stripe_customers`, `stripe_subscriptions`, `stripe_payments`, `stripe_invoices`, `stripe_checkoutSessions`). No changes to `convex/schema.ts`.

### 3.2 Webhook Route

The component's `registerRoutes()` adds a `/stripe/webhook` path to `convex/http.ts`, alongside the existing `/api/rag/search` route. Handles signature verification and event dispatch internally.

### 3.3 Data Flow

```
User clicks "Upgrade"
  → Convex action creates Stripe Checkout Session (mode: "subscription")
  → User redirected to Stripe-hosted checkout page
  → Stripe processes payment
  → Webhook hits {convex-site}/stripe/webhook
  → Component syncs subscription to internal tables
  → useEntitlements() reactively updates UI (no refresh needed)
```

### 3.4 Entitlements Layer

A thin app-level layer that reads component data and maps it to plan/limits:

```
convex/subscriptions.ts           — queries + actions wrapping the component
src/core/hooks/use-entitlements.ts — React hook wrapping the Convex query
```

The entitlements query logic:

- No subscription (or status `canceled`) → `"free"`
- Active subscription with Premium price ID → `"premium"`

Feature code checks:

```typescript
const { plan, limits } = useEntitlements();
if (plan === "free" && appCount >= limits.maxApps) {
  // show upgrade prompt instead of save action
}
```

Limit enforcement also happens server-side in mutations (not just client-side) to prevent race conditions. Convex mutations are transactional, so two concurrent saves can't both succeed past the limit.

## 4. Stripe Configuration (Dashboard)

Create in Stripe Dashboard (test mode first, then live):

- **Product:** "Bridges Premium"
- **Price:** $9.99/month, recurring
- **Customer Portal:** Enable subscription cancellation, payment method updates
- **Webhook endpoint:** `https://{convex-deployment}.convex.site/stripe/webhook`
- **Webhook events:** `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.paid`, `invoice.payment_failed`

---

## 5. Files Changed/Added

| File | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `convex/convex.config.ts` | Modified | Add stripe component registration |
| `convex/http.ts` | Modified | Register stripe webhook routes via `registerRoutes()` |
| `convex/subscriptions.ts` | New | Entitlements queries, checkout session action, portal session action |
| `src/core/hooks/use-entitlements.ts` | New | React hook: `useEntitlements()` → `{ plan, limits }` |
| `src/features/billing/components/upgrade-prompt.tsx` | New | Inline upgrade card shown at limit gates |
| `src/features/billing/components/billing-section.tsx` | New | Settings page section: plan info + manage button |
| `src/features/settings/components/settings-page.tsx` | Modified | Add billing section |
| `src/features/builder/` (gating points) | Modified | Gate app save on free limit |
| `src/features/flashcards/` (gating points) | Modified | Gate deck creation on free limit |

**No changes to `convex/schema.ts`** — the component uses isolated tables.

## 6. Billing UI

### 6.1 Upgrade Touchpoints

**Contextual soft gate:** When a free user hits a limit (e.g., tries to save a 6th app), an inline card appears where the action would normally happen. Not a blocking modal — a gentle prompt. The app they just built stays in the preview; nothing is lost.

**Settings billing section:** New section in the existing Settings page showing current plan, usage stats, and upgrade/manage button. Premium users see "Manage Subscription" which opens Stripe Customer Portal.

### 6.2 Checkout Flow

1. User clicks "Upgrade" (contextual prompt or settings page)
2. Convex action creates Checkout Session with Clerk `userId` as metadata
3. Redirect to Stripe-hosted checkout (handles card input, 3D Secure, Apple/Google Pay)
4. After payment, redirect back to `/settings?billing=success`
5. Webhook fires → component syncs → `useEntitlements()` reactively updates
6. User sees plan change in real-time

### 6.3 Why Stripe-Hosted Checkout

- Handles all payment complexity: validation, 3D Secure, retry UI, mobile layout, Apple Pay / Google Pay
- Zero PCI surface area in our code
- For a single-price subscription, embedding Payment Element adds UI complexity with no user benefit

### 6.4 Cancellation

Entirely through Stripe Customer Portal. User clicks "Manage Subscription" in Settings → Stripe shows portal → user cancels there. Webhook fires → entitlements downgrade to Free. Existing apps are preserved — user just can't create beyond the free limit.

### 6.5 No Pricing Page (v1)

No standalone `/pricing` page. Upgrade is contextual (hit a limit) or via Settings. A dedicated pricing page is a post-launch marketing concern.

---

## 7. Error Handling

| Scenario | Handling |
|---|---|
| Checkout abandoned | No-op. No subscription created, user stays on Free. Sessions expire after 24h. |
| Webhook arrives before redirect | Safe — reactive queries update UI whenever data lands. |
| Payment fails (card declined) | Stripe's checkout handles retry UI. No webhook fires, user stays Free. |
| Subscription lapses (renewal failure) | Stripe retries per configured schedule. On final failure, `customer.subscription.deleted` webhook fires → downgrade to Free. Existing apps preserved. |
| Webhook delivery fails | Stripe retries with exponential backoff for up to 3 days. Component handles idempotency. |
| User deletes Clerk account | Stripe subscription orphaned. Manual cleanup acceptable for v1 (rare edge case). |
| Concurrent saves at limit | Mutation-level count check is transactional — second save rejects. |

---

## 8. Environment Variables

### Convex Dashboard (server-side)

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe API calls (checkout, portal) |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook signature verification |

### `.env.local` (client-side, optional for v1)

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Not required for hosted checkout, but set up for future embedded forms |

---

## 9. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Vitest + convex-test)

- `useEntitlements()` returns correct plan for each subscription state (`active`, `canceled`, `past_due`, no subscription)
- Limit enforcement: mutation rejects app creation at limit for free users, allows for premium
- Checkout session creation action returns a valid URL shape

### Integration Tests

- Stripe test mode + test clock for subscription lifecycle
- Webhook signature verification with test payloads

### Manual QA

- Stripe CLI (`stripe listen --forward-to`) to forward webhooks to local Convex dev
- Test cards: `4242424242424242` (success), `4000000000000002` (declined)

---

## 10. Out of Scope (v1)

- Clinic plan ($29.99/mo per seat) — deferred to v2
- Standalone `/pricing` page
- Usage-based billing or metered pricing
- Proration for mid-cycle plan changes
- Automated cleanup of orphaned Stripe subscriptions on Clerk account deletion
- Free trial period
